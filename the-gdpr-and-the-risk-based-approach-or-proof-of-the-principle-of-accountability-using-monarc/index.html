            <h3 id="a-quick-look-at-the-protection-of-personal-data-in-legislation-in-recent-years">A quick look at the protection of personal data in legislation in recent&nbsp;years</h3>
<p>In its Article 17, Directive 95/46 introduced the notion of “security of processing” by providing that the person responsible for the processing (the “controller”) is required to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data, mainly by taking into account the criteria of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The Directive refers to setting up state-of-the-art measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p><em>Which is all very vague and open to&nbsp;interpretation…</em></p>
<p>The transposition of the Directive into Luxembourg legislation in August 2002 attempted to be more interventionist; its Article 23 includes a number of technical terms, including “equipment access control”, “medium access control”, “memory control”, “access control”,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p><em>But how can best practices in information security be summed up in a single article of a legislative instrument that is only half a page&nbsp;long?</em></p>
<h3 id="a-quick-look-at-risk-management-in-recent-years">A quick look at risk management in recent&nbsp;years</h3>
<p>Throughout the period from 2000 to 2005, the field of information security was in a state of flux, waiting to see who would impose its standard on the international scene. The English were one step ahead, and the first standards to appear were <span class="caps">ISO</span>/<span class="caps">IEC</span> 17799 in 2000 (which was to become <span class="caps">ISO</span>/<span class="caps">IEC</span> 27002), on best practices in information security, and <span class="caps">ISO</span>/<span class="caps">IEC</span> 27001, which introduced the notion of <span class="caps">ISMS</span> (using certification), followed in 2008 by <span class="caps">ISO</span> 27005, which supplies the method for risk management. These standards have now become references; they have been fleshed out, and there is tendency for national standards and methods to converge towards these international&nbsp;standards.</p>
<h3 id="and-now-the-gdpr">And now the <span class="caps">GDPR</span></h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">GDPR</span> comes onto the scene at a time when all these standards have reached maturity, are stable, and widespread throughout Europe. Its recitals, more particularly (76), (77) and (83), use a very specific vocabulary, including phrases such as “likelihood and severity of the risk”, “risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment”, “identification of the risk”,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Lastly, mainly in its Articles 24, 32 and 35, the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> expresses the need to carry out a risk analysis and also an impact assessment to address the risk to the rights and freedoms of the persons&nbsp;concerned.</p>
<h3 id="risk-management-today">Risk management&nbsp;today</h3>
<p>A risk analysis is a structured approach that aims to direct and steer a body in relation to risk. In very simple terms, it is necessary to define the context that is to be studied, then identify the risks (know them) and assess them (quantify them), which makes it possible to arrange them in order, starting with the most critical. All the risks that are considered unacceptable are dealt with so that they are reduced to an acceptable threshold or eliminated. The remaining risks are accepted, since they are&nbsp;negligible.</p>
<p>Apart from its scheduling, the actual risk analysis provides a lot of information, particularly on the exhaustive nature of the risks it truly takes into consideration, their assessment, the values of impact on the organisation and/or the individual, the description of the security measures in place, and of those that will be in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>All this information brought together goes hand in hand with the principle of the accountability of the controller, who uses a risk-based approach to be able to implement security measures, but above all to have available the necessary arguments to prove that processing is <span class="caps">GDPR</span>-compliant.</p>
<h3 id="and-monarc-in-all-this">And <span class="caps">MONARC</span> in all&nbsp;this?</h3>
<p><span class="caps">MONARC</span> is a method for analysing risks coupled with a free tool, making it possible to follow all the best practices in the field of information security. In use, <span class="caps">MONARC</span> adopts the basic criteria of confidentiality (as this is vital when personal data is involved - protection from divulgation), integrity and availability, all of which are particularly relevant in the health field. Impact criteria are directly related to the reputational, operational, legal and financial consequences for the organisation. <span class="caps">MONARC</span> is different in that it introduces naturally the notion of consequences for the person as required by the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> (e.g. the consequences of divulging information from a person’s medical records for that&nbsp;person).</p>
<p>At this level, <span class="caps">MONARC</span> addresses two vital points in the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> by making it possible to couple risk management and impact analysis with regard to the rights and freedoms of the person with regard to data&nbsp;security.</p>
<p>It now remains to deal with the impact of failure to observe the legal aspects of <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, which <span class="caps">MONARC</span> also proposes via its pre-defined risk models. The <span class="caps">DPIA</span>, as defined in Article 35 of the <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, is partly&nbsp;handled.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MONARC</span> is an iterative method that makes it possible to carry out regular reviews which only take into account any changes that have been made. This means that considerable time is saved in achieving&nbsp;compliance.</p>
<p>Lastly, since risk analysis with regard to personal data is carried out, it is highly probable that your organisation’s information system is now partly covered by this analysis. <span class="caps">MONARC</span> simply makes it possible to extend it to your services and job&nbsp;processes.</p>
<p><strong> <span class="caps">MONARC</span> makes it possible to pool the efforts that ensure your compliance with the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> and manage your risks, keeping your activity&nbsp;sustainable. </strong></p>
